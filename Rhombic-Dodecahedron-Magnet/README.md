# Rhombic Dodecahedron Magnet

This is a rhombic dodecahedron with magnets embedded in the sides, as the shape naturally tesselates the magnets help them build on top of each other.

If you want to print this, make sure to add pauses to your gcode so that you can put the magnets in and use a brass extruder.

Here is an image of one printed
